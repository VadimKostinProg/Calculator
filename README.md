Calculator
Desktop calculator application is created with Windows presentation foundation, .Net Framework, C# and Xaml.

Whith help of this program you can solve either simple expresions, or complex ones. It`s forbidden to paste text to calculator from clipboard or type it from keyboard, you can only use buttons in this application.

To use simple arifmetical operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, division, power, factorial) you need just to input expresion with help of buttons and click "=", then result is shown. You can also use brackets for inputing the expresion. There are also function reverse and procents in this calculator. First one computes the result of inputed expresion and divides 1 by the result. Second one divides the result of expresion by 100. To clear the textblock you can click button "AC" and use button "C" as Backspace.

You also can use such constanct as pi number and Euler`s number in your expresion.

Calculator privades you with such functions as square root(button "sqrt"), trigonometrical functions(buttons "sin", "cos", "tan"), logarifmical functions(buttons "log", "lg", "ln"), where "log" is a logarifm with base 2. If you want to use some of this functions you need to click the corrisponding button(for instance "cos"). After that the name of this function will apear on textblock of the calculator, and then you need to type open bracket, value to this function and close bracket(like in this example "cos(pi / 3)").
